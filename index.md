# About

I am an archaeologist and a ceramic enthusiast. I have been studying archaeological pottery from the Andean area, considering its different aspects, but I am also a potter (or at least I try to).

On this page I am looking to post some ideas about pottery, considering how it is and was produced, what can it tell us about the people who made them, and how they were and are used.

Pottery is a very interesting element for understanding society; its plastic nature allow us to create a great number of things, both artistic and functional. Therefore, it can be used in many different ways.
